The file Portfolio_Builder contains the final code that filters the list of stock based off 4 metrics: the Beta value, Sharpe Ratio, Moving Average, and P/E Ratio of each 
individual stock in the portfolio comparing each to the entire list, to get a list of stocks between 12 and 24 that best fit the criteria to beat the market.

A high beta value is strong indicator of growth of a stock when the market goes up, and vice versa. It is the first metric used, as to beat the market, that on average goes up, 
having high beta values ensures that the portfolio will move higher than the market when the market grows.

A high sharpe ratio reduces the risk of the portfolio by showing the best risk-return value. Similarly the moving average shows whether the stock is trending downwards or upwards, if
it is trending downwards it is perhaps not a great stockt to buy.

Finally, using the P/E ratio of each stock, and comparing it to the industry standard we show whether the stock is a growth stock that may boom past the market. All these metrics are 
added together to create a ranking that determines the weight of each stock in the portfolio. Finally we give a graph to show what would have happened had you bought the stock a year ago.
